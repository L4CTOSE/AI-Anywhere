# Zenly Preview (NOT FINISHED!!)

# Zenly Rules & Guidelines
**#** Zenly is a **open source project**, but we kindly ask you not to modify, or fork our projects. We are open source because we want our users to know that our JS Bookmarklet Project is not malicous, but also because it is harder to maintain a closed source project on GitHub rather than a open source project. </br>

**#** Do not Jailbreak our AI, it is for educational purposes only, use this on assignments such as open-ended questions. Do not ask it for the recipe to Methamphetamine or something. </br>

**#** Do not flood our AI bots with messages, or else you will be rate limited for 5 minutes. </br>

**#** Finally, do not share our project **too much**, like if you have a large social media following. This will make it more likely for our projects to be **detected** and **patched**. </br>
