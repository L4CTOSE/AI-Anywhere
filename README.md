# Zenly Preview (Delayed)
Easily access ChatGPT via our Bookmarklet, easily bypassing GoGuardian. We are unable to add AI functionality (the whole purpose of the project) because we need OpenAI Credits to use the ChatGPT API. This will likely be fixed as of September 2023. No worries, though, we will still make updates for this project, but it won't be usable for awhile.. </br>
