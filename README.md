# What is Zenly?
Zenly is an experimental project that I've been working on for the past week that has had an insane amount of updates. Zenly aims to be the "all-in-one" solution for School Assignments and Classwork, Homework, and whatnot. </br>

# Why won't Zenly Chatmode Work?
We can't afford to open an OpenAI API Currently. We'll still update Zenly, but don't expect it to be useable for now.. </br>

# Why is Zenly obfuscated?
Zenly is 100% safe, but we regularly obfuscate our code in order to protect it against competitors </br>

# What if I still don't trust Zenly?
If you still don't trust us, that's your problem. Do you know how much proprietary software you are running on your computer? No. Zenly is just another proprietary app that lets you use ChatGPT's API on almost any website for free. </br>

# What educational websites does Zenly Support?
Google Classroom, Google Docs, Google Forms, EdPuzzle, DeltaMath, Kami
