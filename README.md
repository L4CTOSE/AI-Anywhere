# Experimental Preview
We're not done coding. If you want to test our service, view the Backdoor AI folder <br>

# Controls
Red/Orange Buttons = Close the Window <br>
White Button = Open the Web Browser <br>
Buttons = Pre-made Scripts by me <br>
CTRL + ALT = Quickly Exit the Menu <br>
This project is basically designed to be as idiot-proof as possible <br>
