# Zenly Free Research Preview
We are unable to add AI functionality (basically the whole purpose of the project) because we need OpenAI Credits to use the ChatGPT API. This will likely be fixed by September 2023 when I get enough money to use OpenAI's API. No worries though, we will still make updates for this project, but it won't be functional to auto-complete assignments for awhile... ðŸ’”</br>

If you want, though, you can donate me $5+ and I can create a OpenAI account and pay the $5 account fee ðŸ˜œ
