# Zenly Rules & Guidelines
Zenly is a **open source project**, but we kindly ask you not to modify, or fork our projects. We are open source because we want our users to know that our JS Bookmarklet Project is not malicous, but also because it is harder to maintain a closed source project on GitHub rather than a open source project. </br>
